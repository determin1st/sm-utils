<details><summary>what is templating language?</summary>

> A templating language is a specific syntax or markup that allows for the creation of templates. It provides ways to define placeholders, variables, conditions, loops, and other elements that can be used to generate dynamic content.
> 
> On the other hand, a template processor is a software or tool that takes a template written in a templating language and applies it to specific data to generate an output. It interprets the template using the defined syntax rules and processes the data accordingly. The template processor replaces the placeholders with actual values and executes any logic defined in the template. It can also handle other operations like rendering the template into a final output format, such as HTML, JSON, or plain text.
> 
> In summary, a templating language is the language in which templates are written, while a template processor is the software or tool that interprets and processes those templates to generate the desired output. The templating language provides the rules and structure, while the template processor executes those rules to generate the final result.
</details>
<details><summary>are template processors relevant these days?</summary>

> Yes, template processors are still relevant these days. Template processors are tools or software libraries that allow you to generate dynamic content by combining static text templates with placeholder variables and logic. They are commonly used in web development, email generation, document generation, and other applications where dynamic content creation is required.
> 
> Template processors provide a convenient way to separate the design and presentation of content from the logic or data that drives it, making it easier to manage and maintain. They often support various template languages that offer syntax for conditionals, loops, and other control structures. This allows developers to dynamically generate content based on specific conditions or iterate over data collections.
> 
> Many popular programming frameworks and content management systems also incorporate template processors as a core feature. For example, Django uses its own template engine, and PHP has popular template processors like Smarty and Twig.
> 
> Overall, template processors continue to be relevant because they simplify dynamic content generation, improve code readability and maintainability, and streamline web development and other related tasks.

### history
<details><summary>2008/04 CTemplate </summary>

> Welcome to the C++ CTemplate system!  (This project was originally called Google Templates, due to its origin as the template system used for Google search result pages, but now has a more general name matching its community-owned nature.
> 
> ## Motivation
> 
> A template system can be used to separate output formatting specifications, which govern the appearance and location of output text and data elements, from the executable logic which prepares the data and makes decisions about what appears in the output.
> 
> Template systems lie along a continuum of power versus separation. "Powerful" constructs like variable assignment or conditional statements make it easy to modify the look of an application within the template system exclusively, without having to modify any of the underlying "application logic".  They do so, however, at the cost of separation, turning the templates themselves into part of the application logic.
> 
> This template system leans strongly towards preserving the separation of logic and presentation.  It is intentionally constrained in the features it supports and, as a result, applications tend to require quite a bit of code to instantiate a template.  This may not be to everybody's tastes.  However, while this design limits the power of the template ***language***, it does not limit the power or flexibility of the template ***system***.  This system supports arbitrarily complex text formatting.  Many Google applications, including the "main" Google web search, use this system for formatting output.
> 
> Finally, this system is designed with an eye towards efficiency. Template instantiation is very quick, with an eye towards minimizing both memory use and memory fragmentation.

<details><summary>2008/04 Erlang Template Engine (Prototype)</summary>

> Some may argue, that it is pointless to write one's own template engine. But what if there's no suitable one? Common template engines are too heavy, provide enormous functionality, most of which is unnecessary rubbish, if you use templates right. What do I mean by right use of templates? To answer this question, I would like you to answer another one: what templates are intended for? Templates are intended for representation, hence must not include any logic. Logic is for developers, templates are for designers. Only template engines following this concept but still fully-functional I'm aware of are PHPLib's Template and Google CTemplate. Update: Plus Template::Simple for Perl.
> 
> Several years ago I wrote a template engine in Perl, which used PHPLib syntax, but had object-oriented approach for templates, so that every template or block inside a template was an object. If I get round to that, I'll clean up the code and post it in this blog later, and perhaps switch to Google CTemplate syntax, which I discovered recently.
> 
> If we deal with an object-oriented language, the natural way of representing a template is wrapping it into an object, using object's properties for template's variables and regarding nested templates as nested objects.
> 
> Erlang is a functional programming language. What is the natural way to express anything in a functional programming language? Right, wrap it into a function! In this article I present my experiment of creating a template engine using functional paradigm.
> 
> My Erlang template engine uses Google CTemplate syntax. Template variables are expressed through function arguments, and nested templates are expressed through descent calls to other functions.

### performance
running in ***the JIT mode***<sup>[◥](https://php.watch/versions/8.0/JIT)</sup>,
this implementation is comparable to various JS implementations:
[![perf](mm/mustache-perf.jpg)](#performance)

### principles
- `logic-less` - in comparison with other template processors, where data is sliced and diced inside the template, this implementation strives to control the **data flow** through the template. in practice, it looks like **more concise syntax** with selections instead of cryptic expressions. thus, **less mental load** - more templating.
- `data for template` - template is more important than data, a variety sets of data may fit into a single template. paths used in the **template should look nice**, readable and explanatory. the question of escaping sigils to accommodate data should never arise - avoid `template for data` at all costs, do a preliminary **data massaging** when necessary.
- `null-free` - a **null**<sup>[◥][php-null]</sup> is the absence of data. the absence of data leads to the search for imperative solution in the template, which contradicts the `logic-less` principle. thus, to fill the gaps, the [use of helpers](#preparation) is recommended - replace nulls with special case values.

### clauses
[![clause](mm/mustache-clause.jpg)](#clauses)
> *The army consists of the first infantry division and eight million replacements.*
> 
> **Sebastian Junger**

the smallest unit of
***mustache language***<sup>[◥][m-lang]</sup>
is the ***clause***<sup>[◥][m-clause]</sup>
which is ***removed or replaced***<sup>[◥][substitution]</sup>
in the [resulting output](#examples).

a clause consists of:
- [delimiters](#delimiters)
- [sigil](#sigils) (optional)
- [path](#paths) or ***literal***<sup>[◥][literal]</sup> or ***annotation***<sup>[◥][annotation]</sup> (optional)

there are two kinds of clauses:
- ***independent***<sup>[◥][m-clause-ind]</sup> are [variables](#variables) and [comments](#comments).
- ***dependent***<sup>[◥][m-clause-dep]</sup> are composed in [blocks](#blocks).

### indentation
[![clause-pads](mm/mustache-clause-pads.jpg)](#indentation)

***for better appearance***<sup>[◥][readability]</sup>,
all [clause](#clauses) components -
[delimiters](#delimiters), [sigil](#sigils) and [path](#paths)
***can align with each other***<sup>[◥][free-form]</sup>
using ***whitespace***<sup>[◥][whitespace]</sup>.


### delimiters
[![delims](mm/mustache-delims.jpg)](#delimiters)

***delimiters***<sup>[◥][m-delims]</sup> are
a ***pair of markers***
that ***frame the stem***<sup>[◥][circumfix]</sup>
of a [clause](#clauses) in the template.
the default are **`{{`** and **`}}`**
which look like a ***moustache***<sup>[◥][moustache]</sup>.

the first delimiter is called ***opening***,
the second - ***closing***.
<details><summary>what balanced delimiters are?</summary>

> Balanced delimiters refer to a pair of opening and closing symbols, such as parentheses "()," brackets "[]," or curly braces "{}," used in programming languages and mathematical expressions to group and organize elements. They are called balanced because they ensure that the order and nesting of the delimiters are proper and consistent.
> 
> The term "balanced" implies that for a set of delimiters to be considered balanced, every opening symbol must have a corresponding closing symbol, and they must match in terms of type (e.g., an opening parenthesis matches with a closing parenthesis). Moreover, the order in which the delimiters appear must follow a hierarchical structure, meaning that each opening delimiter must be closed before a higher-level delimiter can be closed.
> 
> For example, the expression "(2 + 3) * [4 / {5 - 1}]" contains balanced delimiters because each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol, and the nested order of the delimiters is correct. If any opening or closing symbol is missing, or if the order of the delimiters is incorrect, the expression would be considered unbalanced.
</details>

***custom delimiters*** can be
[set once during instantiation](#custom-delimiters).
some examples: `{: :}`, `/* */`, `<{ }>`, `<[ ]>`,
`<% %>`, `[% %]`, `{% %}`, `(( ))`, `[[ ]]`,
`<!--{ }-->`, `{{{ }}}`.

such balanced delimiters do not have to mirror each other or
be of equal length, but they ***must differ***
to avoid ***delimiter collision***.
a single character may also be used as a delimiter, but:
> *There is no such thing as accident; It is fate misnamed.*
> 
> **Napoleon Bonaparte**

<details><summary>what is delimiter collision?</summary>

> Delimiter collision refers to a situation where the chosen delimiter used to separate data fields within a dataset appears within the actual data itself, leading to ambiguity and confusion.
> 
> This problem often arises in data processing, particularly when dealing with structured data formats such as CSV (comma-separated values) files or plain text documents with delimiters. These delimiters are crucial for software to correctly identify and separate the individual data fields.
> 
> When the chosen delimiter is mistakenly present within the data, it can cause issues during parsing or processing the data. For example, if a comma is chosen as the delimiter and a data field contains a comma as part of its value, the software may incorrectly interpret the comma within the field as a delimiter, resulting in the data being split into undesired parts.
> 
> Similarly, if a delimiter collision occurs in a plain text document, it may cause problems when extracting or analyzing the data using text mining or natural language processing techniques. This can lead to errors, loss of data integrity, and inaccurate analysis or insights.
> 
> To address delimiter collision, various strategies can be employed. One approach is to use a different delimiter or to select more unique and less likely characters as delimiters, such as special characters or combinations of characters. Another approach is to employ escaping techniques, where the delimiter within the data is preceded by an escape character to indicate that it should be treated as part of the data rather than a delimiter.
> 
> Overall, delimiter collision is an important consideration when working with datasets and requires careful planning and handling to ensure accurate and reliable data processing.
</details>

### sigils
[![sigil](mm/mustache-sigil.jpg)](#sigils)

a ***sigil***<sup>[◥][sigil]</sup>
is a ***symbol***<sup>[◥][symbol]</sup>
that is ***suffixed***<sup>[◥][suffix]</sup>
to [the opening delimiter](#delimiters).

a ***sigil*** effectively ***denotes the type*** of [clause](#clauses):
- `&` - [variable](#variables) (optional modifier)
- `!` - [commentary](#comments)
- `#`,`^`,`@` - [primary section](#blocks)
- `|` - [alternative section](#or-section)
- `/` - [terminus](#terminus)

### paths
[![path](mm/mustache-path.jpg)](#paths)

a ***path***<sup>[◥][m-path]</sup>
consists of ***names*** and ***dots***<sup>[◥][dot]</sup>
that indicate ***the address of a value***<sup>[◥][name-binding]</sup>
on [the context stack](#the-context-stack).

every ***name*** in the path denotes
an ***array key***<sup>[◥][name-value]</sup>
or ***object property***<sup>[◥][property]</sup>
which should exist within the ***container***<sup>[◥][container]</sup>
somewhere on [the stack](#the-context-stack).

it is crusial to follow a rigid
***naming convention***<sup>[◥][naming]</sup> -
use of ***alphanumeric characters***<sup>[◥][alnum]</sup>
and one of word combinatory practices -
***hyphen-case***<sup>[◥][hyphen-case]</sup>,
***camelCase***<sup>[◥][camelCase]</sup> or
***snake_case***<sup>[◥][snake_case]</sup>
is recommended.
the name cannot contain a ***dot***<sup>[◥][dot]</sup>
or ***whitespace***<sup>[◥][whitespace]</sup>
characters - they have a special meaning.

#### absolute path
[![path-abs](mm/mustache-path-abs.jpg)](#absolute-path)

a ***path*** that is ***prefixed***<sup>[◥][prefix]</sup>
with ***one or multiple dots***
is called ***absolute***<sup>[◥][abs-path]</sup>.
the number of dots represents a ***backpedal***
that enables ***explicit value addressing***<sup>[◥][stack-peek]</sup>
on [the stack](#the-context-stack).

examples: `.name`, `..name`, `...name`

a ***special case*** of an absolute path
is when it contains ***no names at all*** -
the value is simply taken from the stack.

examples: `.`, `...`, `.....`

#### relative path
a [path](#paths) that is [not absolute](#absolute-path)
(has no backpedal)
is called ***relative***<sup>[◥][rel-path]</sup> -
its first name is ***searched once***<sup>[◥][linear-search]</sup>
on [the stack](#the-context-stack).
the ***search***<sup>[◥][linear-search]</sup>
is conducted ***inside containers***<sup>[◥][container]</sup>,
starting ***from the top of the stack***.

examples: `name`, `name-of-the-city`, `nameOfTheFunction`

relative path ***cannot be empty***,
it always consists of ***one or multiple names***.

#### dot notation
[![path-rel](mm/mustache-path-rel.jpg)](#dot-notation)

***multiple names*** in the path
***are joined***<sup>[◥][interfix]</sup>
with the ***dot***<sup>[◥][dot]</sup> character.

examples: `user.name`, `..absolute.path`, `relative-path.to.value`

lets examine how the ***dot notation*** applies
for the `first.second` path:
there are two names - the `first` name
is looked up and found on the stack,
it points to the container in which
the `second` name resides.
the `second` name is associated with
a value that is returned as the result
of path resolution.
for the `first.second.third` path - the rule extrapolates -
the `third` value must be extracted from the `second` container
which must be extracted from the `first` container
which must be found on the stack.

#### lambda path
[![path-lambda](mm/mustache-path-lambda.jpg)](#lambda-path)

when a ` ` ***space***<sup>[◥][space]</sup> character
is met ***in the path***, it denotes the end of
[the path that resolves to lambda](#lambdas) and
the start of the ***argument***<sup>[◥][argument]</sup>
to that ***lambda***<sup>[◥][lambda]</sup>.
the ***lambda is invoked*** during the rendering process and
the result of the call is taken as a value the path resolves.

for example in the `utils.isEven _index` path,
the `utils.isEven` is the actual [relative path](#relative-path)
that should resolve to ***lambda function***<sup>[◥][lambda]</sup>
and the `_index` ***literal***<sup>[◥][literal]</sup>
will be passed as its argument.


### variables
[![var](mm/mustache-var.jpg)](#variables)

a ***variable***<sup>[◥][m-var]</sup>
is an ***independent***<sup>[◥][m-clause-ind]</sup>
[clause](#clauses)
of ***mustache language***<sup>[◥][m-lang]</sup>
that consists of [delimiters](#delimiters)
and [path](#paths).

examples: `{{relative.path}}`, `{{.absolute.path}}`,
`{{random 1,100}}`, `{{.}}`

> *Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.*
> 
> **Albert Einstein**

a ***variable***<sup>[◥][m-var]</sup>
may be ***affixed***<sup>[◥][affix]</sup>
with the **`&`** [sigil](#sigils) -
a ***modifier***<sup>[◥][modifier]</sup>
that [controls the escaping](#escaping)
of the value.
***escaping***<sup>[◥][escape-char]</sup>
is only a historical title for
a common ***post-processing mechanism***
which ***is disabled by default*** -
the affix has no effect.

examples: `{{&user-input}}`, `{{&.code.javascript}}`

### comments
[![comment](mm/mustache-comment.jpg)](#comments)

a ***comment***<sup>[◥][m-comment]</sup>
is an ***independent***<sup>[◥][m-clause-ind]</sup>
[clause](#clauses)
of ***mustache language***<sup>[◥][m-lang]</sup>
that consists of [delimiters](#delimiters),
the **`!`** [sigil](#sigils)
and ***annotation***<sup>[◥][annotation]</sup>:
```
{{!

  When I read commentary
  about suggestions for where C should go,
  I often think back and give thanks that
  it wasn't developed under
  the advice of a worldwide crowd.

  Dennis Ritchie 🚀

}}
```
[upon rendering](#rendering), a comment
***is stripped***<sup>[◥][substitution]</sup>
from the [resulting output](#examples).


### blocks
[![block](mm/mustache-block.jpg)](#blocks)

a ***block***<sup>[◥][m-block]</sup>
consists of one or more ***sections***<sup>[◥][m-section]</sup> and
a [terminus](#terminus).

a ***section***<sup>[◥][m-section]</sup>
consists of a ***dependent***<sup>[◥][m-clause-ind]</sup>
[clause](#clauses)
and a ***section's content***<sup>[◥][template]</sup>
that ends with a [terminus](#terminus) or ***another section***.

> *A dependent clause is like a dependent child: incapable of standing on its own but able to cause a lot of trouble.*
> 
> **William Safire**

the ***first section*** of a block
aka the ***primary section*** -
denotes the ***block type***.
its [clause](#clauses)
represents a ***conditional construct***<sup>[◥][m-conditional]</sup>
that tests resolved ***value***<sup>[◥][value]</sup>
for [truthiness or falsiness](#truthy-or-falsy) -
the ***result***<sup>[◥][boolean]</sup>
influences the way the block renders.

available ***block types*** ([sigils](#sigils)) are:
- [**`#`**](#truthy-block),[**`@`**](#iterator-block) - [expects truthy](#truthy-or-falsy)
- [**`^`**](#falsy-block) - [expects falsy](#truthy-or-falsy)

any ***subsequent section***<sup>[◥][cond-subsequent]</sup>
is called an [alternative section](#or-section)
and its [clause](#clauses) ***is affixed***<sup>[◥][affix]</sup>
with [**`|`** sigil](#or-section).

[upon rendering](#rendering), a block is
***removed or replaced***<sup>[◥][substitution]</sup>
as a whole.

#### truthy or falsy
> *I cannot comprehend how any man can want anything but the truth.*
> 
> **Marcus Aurelius**

the [path](#paths) of a ***primary section***
resolves to a ***value***<sup>[◥][value]</sup>
which ***is coerced***<sup>[◥][coercion]</sup>
to a ***boolean***<sup>[◥][boolean]</sup>.
when it coerces to ***false*** - its ***falsy***,
otherwise, it is ***true*** and ***truthy***.

this ***mustache***<sup>[◥][m-lang]</sup> implementation
defines the following ***falsy values***:
- `null` - ***value not found*** or ***lambda returns null***
- `false` - ***boolean***<sup>[◥][boolean]</sup> (without coercion)
- `0` - ***zero number***<sup>[◥][zero]</sup>
- `''` - ***empty string***<sup>[◥][empty-string]</sup>
- `[]` - empty ***array***<sup>[◥][php-array]</sup> or ***countable object***<sup>[◥][php-countable]</sup>

every other value - is ***truthy value***.


#### FALSY block
[![block-falsy](mm/mustache-block-falsy.jpg)](#falsy-block)

this block type ***is the simplest*** -
its primary section is rendered only when [the path](#paths)
resolves to [falsy](#truthy-or-falsy).
```
{{^user.active}}
  user {{user.name}} is not active
{{/}}

{{^array-count}}
  array is empty
{{/}}
```
note that ***countable container***<sup>[◥][php-countable]</sup> value
is ***negated***<sup>[◥][negation]</sup>
by its ***elements count***:
```
{{^array}}
  array is empty
{{/}}
```

#### TRUTHY block
[![block-truthy](mm/mustache-block-truthy.jpg)](#truthy-block)

the primary section of this block
is rendered only when [the path](#paths)
resolves to [truthy](#truthy-or-falsy).

for a ***boolean*** value,
it behaves the ***same as negated***<sup>[◥][negation]</sup>
[falsy block](#falsy-block):
```
{{#user.active}}
  user {{user.name}} is active
{{/}}
```
for a ***non-boolean scalar*** (string or number) or
for a ***non-countable container*** (array or object),
the value is pushed to [the context stack](#the-context-stack)
and becomes a ***temporary helper*** that is accessible
with a [`.` backpedal](#absolute-path)
and is pulled after a single render:
```
{{#array-count}}
  number of elements in array: {{.}}
{{/}}

{{#user}}
  user name is {{.name}}
{{/}}
```
for a ***countable container***<sup>[◥][php-countable]</sup>
(array or object), the value ***is iterated*** -
each element is pushed to [the context stack](#the-context-stack),
rendered and pulled out:
```
{{#array}}
  value={{.}};
{{/}}
```
that is, the primiary section is rendered as many times,
as many elements are in the container,
but the stack expands only for a single value.

#### ITERATOR block
[![block-iter](mm/mustache-block-iter.jpg)](#iterator-block)

this block improves the ***iteration capability***<sup>[◥][iterator]</sup>
of the [truthy block](#truthy-block) and
introduces ***traversion capability***.
a ***truthy value*** resolved from [the path](#the-path)
must be a ***countable container***<sup>[◥][php-countable]</sup>,
otherwise a [processing exception](#errors) will be thrown.

this implementation designates
***index-based arrays*** for ***iteration***,
while ***key-based aka associative arrays***
for ***traversion***.

a set of ***auxiliary variables*** is created
for both variants:
- `_count` - ***number*** of elements
- `_first` - first iteration/traversion ***indicator***<sup>[◥][boolean]</sup>
- `_last` - last iteration/traversion ***indicator***<sup>[◥][boolean]</sup>
- `_index` - current iteration/traversion ***number***<sup>[◥][index]</sup>
- `_key` - current traverion name ***string***<sup>[◥][string]</sup>

these enhance the rendering
of ***containers***<sup>[◥][container]</sup>:
```
{{@array}}
  {{_index}}={{.}};
{{/}}

{{@array}}
  {{.}}{{^_last}},{{/}}
{{/}}

{{@path.to.traversable.object}}
  {{_key}}: {{.}}{{^_last}},{{/}}
{{/}}
```
while rendering, both ***iteration*** and ***traversal***
expand [the stack](#the-context-stack) with the current value
which may be accessed with [`.` backpedal](#absolute-path).
***auxiliary variables*** have
a similar [`_` backpedal](#absolute-path),
but they live in a separate stack and
only pertain to [iterator blocks](#iterator-block):
```
date,time,info;
{{@events}}
  {{@.}}
    {{__key}},{{_key}},{{.}};
  {{/}}
{{/}}
```
It is important to note that
***iteration requires*** that
all ***elements*** in the container
are ***of the same type***.

#### OR section
[![or](mm/mustache-or.jpg)](#or-section)

every block type may have
an ***alternative section***<sup>[◥][mutual-exclusion]</sup>
that ***renders once*** the primary condition is unmet
and ***it does not push anything*** to [the stack](#the-context-stack):
```
{{#number}}
  the number is {{.}}
{{|}}
  the number is zero or 0 or not found
{{/}}

{{^number}}
  the number is zero or 0 or not found
{{|}}
  the number is non-zero, {{number}}
{{/}}
```
being the opposite of
the ***primary conditional***<sup>[◥][m-conditional]</sup>,
the ***OR section***<sup>[◥][disjunction]</sup>
construct allows to save on blocks count:
```
{{#array-count}}
  array is not empty
{{/}}
{{^array-count}}
  array is empty
{{/}}

VS

{{#array-count}}
  array is not empty
{{|}}
  array is empty
{{/}}
```
a profound application may be found with iterators:
```
{{@array}}
  index={{_index}},value={{.}};
{{|}}
  array is empty
{{/}}
```

#### SWITCH block
[![block-switch](mm/mustache-block-switch.jpg)](#switch-block)

a [truthy block](#truthy-block) or a [falsy block](#falsy-block)
that contains a ***conditional OR section*** aka ***CASE section***
is called a ***switch block***<sup>[◥][m-switch]</sup>:
```
{{#path.to.value}}
  TRUTHY default,
  will match non-zero number or non-empty string
{{|}}
  FALSY default,
  will only match the empty string since
  there is a CASE with number zero
{{|0}}
  will match 0,"0"
{{|1}}
  will match 1,"1"
{{|2}}
  will match 2,"2"
{{|hello}}
  will match "hello" string
{{/}}
```
the ***CASE section***
contains a ***literal***<sup>[◥][literal]</sup>
which ***is matched*** in the first place:
```
{{^number-that-is-zero}}
  will never render
{{|0}}
  will render
{{/}}
```
both ***primary section*** and
[OR section](#or-section) without a ***literal***<sup>[◥][literal]</sup>
aka ***unconditional CASE section***
may be represented as ***default cases***
in an underlying ***metalanguage***<sup>[◥][metalanguage]</sup>:
```php
switch (stringify(path.to.value)) {
case "0":
  # ...
  break;
case "1":
  # ...
  break;
case "2":
  # ...
  break;
case "hello":
  # ...
  break;
default:
  if (path.to.value)
  {
    # TRUTHY default
    # ...
  }
  else
  {
    # FALSY default
    # ...
  }
  break;
}
```
a ***fallthrough CASE section***<sup>[◥][m-fallthrough]</sup>
is also possible:
```
{{^number}}
  zero
{{|1|2|3}}
  one or two or three
{{|
    4|5
}}
  four or five
{{|6}}
  six
{{|}}
  unknown number
{{/}}
```
[the path](#paths) of this [block](#blocks)
must resolve to a ***numeric or string value***,
otherwise a [processing exception](#errors) is thrown.
to match ***CASE section*** literals,
a ***number is coerced***<sup>[◥][coercion]</sup>
to a string.

#### terminus
[![terminus](mm/mustache-terminus.jpg)](#terminus)

a ***terminus***<sup>[◥][m-terminus]</sup>
is a ***dependent***<sup>[◥][m-clause-dep]</sup>
[clause](#clauses)
of ***mustache language***<sup>[◥][m-lang]</sup>
that consists of [delimiters](#delimiters),
the **`/`** [sigil](#sigils)
and an optional ***annotation***<sup>[◥][annotation]</sup>.

the only purpose of a ***terminus***<sup>[◥][m-terminus]</sup>
is to ***terminate the block***<sup>[◥][boundary-marker]</sup>.
```
{{/

  a terminus clause may look like a comment, irrelevant,
  but it depends on block's might, without it,
  there will be a terrible failure - a barbarian invasion!

  the opposite is also true - when a terminus is plowed
  by ignorant peasant, the block demarks itself as open
  to worldwide scum - a terrible failure!

an ***instance***<sup>[◥][instance]</sup>
of `SM\Mustache` must be created:
```php
$m = \SM\Mustache::new();# with default options
```
emperimenting requires only this bare minimum:
```php
echo $m->prepare(# outputs: "Hello world!"

  'Hello {{name}}!',  # 0: template
  ['name'=>'world']   # 1: data

);
echo $m->prepare(# outputs: "Hello world!"

  'Hello {.}!', # 0: template
  'world',      # 1: data
  '{ }'         # 2: custom delimiters

);
```
a `prepare` method is used
either for [preparations](#preparation) or
for ***experimenting***<sup>[◥][experiment]</sup>
with the engine.

### instance options
#### custom delimiters
both opening/left and closing/right delimiters
are passed in a single string
separated with a ` ` space character:
```php
$m = \SM\Mustache::new([

  'delims' => '<< >>'

]);
echo $m->prepare(# outputs: "Hello world!"

  'Hello <<.>>!',
  'world'

);
```

#### escaping
post-processing is disabled by default,
to enable a simple ***HTML escaping***<sup>[◥][php-htmlspecialchars]</sup>
pass the `true`:
```php
$m = \SM\Mustache::new([

  'escape' => true

]);
echo $m->prepare(# outputs: "Hello O&#039;Reily!"

  'Hello {{&name}}!',
  ['name' => "O'Reily"]

);
```
to do a custom..


#### booleans
by default, ***boolean***<sup>[◥][boolean]</sup>
values (either `true` or `false`) render to empty.



### the context stack
[![stack](mm/mustache-stack.jpg)](#the-context-stack)

for example, in the `.name` path,
a ***single dot***<sup>[◥][dot]</sup>
points to the ***top of the stack***,
which must be the ***container***<sup>[◥][container]</sup>
where the `name` resides.
in the `..name`, there is a ***double dot***
pointing downwards (***top to bottom***)
to the ***second container***<sup>[◥][container]</sup>
on [the stack](#the-context-stack) and the `name` value inside that container.
in the `...name`, a ***triple dot*** points to
the ***third value*** on [the stack](#the-context-stack)
and so on..

[![path-backpedal](mm/mustache-path-backpedal.jpg)](#absolute-path)

internally, mustache instance represents
a ***stack***<sup>[◥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))</sup>.

any ***composite data***<sup>[◥][composite]</sup>
(an ***array***<sup>[◥](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php)</sup>
or an ***object***<sup>[◥](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php)</sup>)
pushed to the stack prior to template processing
is called a ***helper*** aka helper data aka
data that helps in rendering.

helpers may be set at instantiation:
```php
$m = SM\Mustache::new([# push one
  'helper' => $helper1
]);
$m = SM\Mustache::new([# push many
  'helpers' => [$helper1, $helper2, $helper3]
]);
```
or afterwards:
```php
$m->push($helper1);
$m->push($helper2)->push($helper3);
```
they can be removed with:
```php
$m->pull();# removes $helper3
$m->pull(true);# removes all
```


```php
$m = SM\Mustache::new([
  'helpers' => [
    ['name' => 'Joe',   'age' => 81, 'another' => ['name' => 'Sleepy']],
    ['name' => 'Barak', 'age' => 62],
    ['name' => 'Donald','another' => ['term' => 2024]]
  ]
]);
$m->value('name');# Donald
$m->value('age');# 62
$m->value('another.name');# NOT FOUND ~ null
$m->value('...another.name');# Sleepy
```
when `.` precedes a path, the value is fetched
rather than looked up, that is,
the `.` selector points to the top of the stack,
`..` to the second value from the top, etc.
```php
echo $m->value('.name');# Donald
echo $m->value('..name');# Barak
echo $m->value('...name');# Joe
```
### preparation<!--{{{-->
> *There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.*
> 
> **Colin Powell**

delimiters are set once for the
***instance***<sup>[◥][instance]</sup>
:
```php
$m = SM\Mustache::new(['delims' => '<% %>']);
```
or, arbitrarily, with
[preparational methods](#preparation)
:
```php
$txt = $m->prepare($template, $data, '[[ ]]');
$id  = $m->prep($template, '{: :}');;
```

### compilation (cache preset)

yes, that's a feature i want to deviate a bit.
make it opt in instead of opt out,
meaning that {{&userInput}} is whats going to be escaped.
im not sure how to do that, maybe an option to the instance
that inverts default behavior.
it is based on HTML and proposition that
templates are typed by users.
developer knows exactly what "stage" currently is and
whether it s a user input or template composition.

oke, let me explain how i see stage things in
the modern template EVALuator.
HTML-only days are over, so it must be generic view.

stage 1: preparation
templates should be somehow beautiful and
easy to read and to modify - for example,
check how beautiful are json spec files -
long one-liners with zero indentation,
yaml files, in this case, arent the source of truth,
because they bypass stage 1 implicitly.
json is what we need, big lengthy json objects
with infinite one-liners.. (put some irony here).

i think you agree that template storage represents
a hasmap - name=>template content,
it can be filename (still a name) or json object key,
also a name bound with content - string type.
php arrays are better than JSON files, aesthetically.
i bet any language does better job in template sourcing -
better representation for a developer.

single template, one may wish to see is:

{:BR:}{:TAB:}
Hey, {{name}}, you are {:#ansi_color red:}{{age}}{:/ansi_color:} years old!

this tiny indentation brings an issue to non-HTML sources.
"remove indentation around standalone blocks"
feature in mustache doesnt fully do OUTdentation.
the issue is obscure in HTML,
because HTML usually eats any whitespace in the view.
same as in yaml files, you dont see it.
i think that explicit outdentation is required.
mine has two methods for this stage:

function outdent(string $template): string;
function prepare(string $template, mixed $data=null, string $customDelimiters=''): string

the process may look like

foreach ($templateStorage as $name => &$template) {
  $template = $m->prepare($m->outdent($template), $initialData, '{: :}');
}
initial data may look like

[
  'BR' => "\n",
  'TAB' => "\t",
  'ansi_color' => (function(..){..}),
]
now template is explicitly indented for the target source (console/terminal that supports ansi sequences)

stage 2: compilation or cache preSET
this is completely optional. the only benefit of this stage is significant performance jump which is related to addressing mechanism - instead of copying potentially large strings and calculating hashes over them, you use identifiers. this not required for experiments or few template renderings. mine has a method:

function set(string $template): int
the process is similar

foreach ($templateStorage as $name => &$template) {
  $template = $m->set($template);
}
now templates are integers. getting text back is possible.

stage 3: rendering
is also optional. experiments and playgrounds dont need methods that use cache. few template renders are fine with prepare(). otherwise, yours is some kind of an app that renders periodically and able to benefit from caching and memoization. mine has:

function render(string $template, mixed $data=null): string;
function get(int $template, mixed $data=null): string;
rendering may look like

$result = $m->render($templateStorage[$name], $data);# or when precached
$result = $m->get($templateStorage[$name], $data);
regarding to lambdas,
i suppose that most of them will live a short life at the stage 1 and wont be invoked periodically as projected for stage 3. there is no need for constant ansi wraps or other special/control character insertion in a thoughtful template.

@jgonggrijp

So if I understand correctly, your implementation makes two passes over the template, one as a kind of preprocessing/macro expansion step and one for the final rendering.

yes, stage 1 and 2 can be treated as a single step.

What does the use ($ANSI) notation, between the function parameter list and the function body, mean in PHP?

it only passes external variable for use. in JS that is achieved by closure scopes, phps have that use () clause.

@agentgt

type NODE = STRING | BOOL | NULL | NUMBER | OBJECT | LIST | NODE
They do not know that "a" will even be there. However unlike the reflective model where it could be anything they just need to recursively pattern match the above.

With the reflective model you have to ask the type "tell me everything about you". In the transform model you ask "which of these types are you"?

i see it as optimization properties. i did some type memoization which is based on template then data, not data then template. im not determined about actual structure yet. for example {{lambda argument}} is clearly a function - because it has an argument - no need to typecheck here, so ill select fragility over implicit stability

also consider cache fragility:

$template = $m->outdent('

  {{#list}}
    {{.}}
  {{/list}}

');
echo $m->render($template, ['list'=>[1,2,3,4,5]]);# prints 12345, template is cached
echo $m->render($template, ['list'=>['one','two','three']]);# FATAL! - expecting integers in the array
echo $m->prepare($template, ['list'=>['one','two','three']]);# prints onetwothree, template cache is ignored
