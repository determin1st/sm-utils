³Ö
À¶ A major change was made by the first Emperor,
 º Augustus (27 BC ? 14 AD), who reformed revenue
 º collection, bringing large parts of Rome?s empire
 º under consistent direct taxation instead of asking
 º for intermittent tributes. Taxation was determined
 º by population census and private tax farming
 º was abolished in favor for civil service tax collectors.
 º This made provincial administration far more tolerable,
 º decreased corruption and oppression and
 º increased revenues.

À¶ Slavery burden
 º While it is true that the Roman Empire wasn?t as heavily
 º bureaucratized as the Han Dynasty of Imperial China,
 º the Roman Empire did have a bureaucracy even in this early
 º imperial period that tends to be underestimated; the officials,
 º as stated above, had a large number of slaves who worked
 º informally in administrative jobs.

³Ö
À¶ Rome has been called by some historians a confederation
 º of city-states and that is true as the Roman state
 º preferred on a local level to delegate tasks to city-states
 º and in provinces that did not have such traditions,
 º Rome brought them into being as far as it could.
 º City authorities had to maintain order and extract revenue
 º not only for the city itself but also from the countryside
 º that was allocated to that city and where
 º the majority of the population lived.

³Ö
À¶ Tax burden
 º Under Diocletian and Constantine in the late third and
 º early fourth centuries, the Roman Empire underwent an even
 º greater bureaucratization in order to deal with the threat
 º of external enemies and internal instability.
 º The Empire was to be ruled by two Emperors, one in the West
 º and one in the East, who could respond faster to internal
 º and external threats. In order to maintain a large army
 º to defend the Empire from the ?barbarian? threat,
 º more taxes were needed.
